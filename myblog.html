            <p class="pad_top2"><strong>Problem Identified: </strong><br></p>
                <p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
                    Poor Waste Management. (Non-Biodegradable waste) </p>
In view of the fact that the government tries but is inefficient in driving a city-wide waste collection scheme in such an over-populated community with a poor recycling culture, Team Tidy has taken it upon ourselves to come up with a solution to the problem of poor waste management in the society.
            <p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
When waste is not properly disposed, it leads to a whole lot of problems.
                Most of the diseases that burden us are attributable to poor waste management and sanitation. When the environment gets polluted, there is an increased rate of diseases. Some non-biodegradable waste are made of chemicals which when left over time may pollute the soil , causing a decrease in its nutrient content and  not enabling plants to grow well. This in turn causes nutritional stunting to humans and animals, the final consumers and denies them the ability to fight against diseases caused by poor waste management.</p>
            <p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
                Very often, the gutters are clogged with waste and when the rains come, the roads get flooded and accidents are more likely to occur, resulting in the loss of lives and property. The lives lost cause a decrease in the labor force, thereby resulting in a decline in the countryâ€™s economy and this results in a recession where things such as medical treatment become expensive and unaffordable and people who suffer from poor sanitation may not survive. With a continuous occurrence of this, the country keeps deteriorating as a whole. Such things considered insignificant like a clogged gutter go a long way in causing harm directly or indirectly. (Worst Case Scenario).</p>
           <p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
               In addition, lack of adequate sanitation is a major threat to the environment. The urban environment degrades over time with the indiscriminate disposal of refuse and this makes the environment less attractive and discourages habitation.
The effects of poor waste management are immeasurable and the cost of repairing environmental damages is great.
                
<p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
    With the effects of the problems mentioned above, we felt it necessary to come up with a feasible solution. We decided to serve as an intermediary between the waste generators and the waste recyclers (We plan to work with waste recycling companies like Eco Future). We would provide a platform where consumers can drop their non-biodegradable waste and receive incentives in return, as we strongly believe that wasting your waste is a waste and waste recycling companies we would be working with would come to collect waste for recycling and pay us in return. We would also partner with companies and organizations who see the need for a cleaner society, and who would be willing to provide funds, resources and sponsorship to TEAM TIDY. We would have a website where waste generators would be able to register as users and monitor the impact they make on the society (the amount of waste they have dropped for recycling and reducing the amount of waste found littered in the community). The website would also have additional information and articles that emphasize the importance of proper waste management, thereby creating awareness.</p>
<p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
    We plan to start small in some parts of Lagos like Makoko which is considered a slum dwelling.
    While planning amongst ourselves our design model and trying to offer constructive criticism, an interesting question came up. Who are our target users and why should we bother building a website when our aim can be achieved physically and our awareness messages passed using fliers?</p>
            <p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">
                We considered that the average low income earner may not have access to a smartphone or internet or even the website, but we also took into consideration that low income earners are not the only waste generators. People who earn well usually have a higher purchasing power and therefore are more likely to generate waste. We also realized that the society is fast moving forward and in the near future, every average individual would have access to technology. So, it is best to be futuristic and at the same time realistic so as to not get left behind. In view of this, we agreed that building a website to support the business was not a bad idea.</p>
<p class="pad_bot1 pad_top2">'On our website, we would show the progress made and how much waste has been submitted for recycling monthly. This would help us measure how far we have come and the money generated over time would be used to extend the company to other communities to make a greater impact.

    With this business plan, we would have a much cleaner and habitable environment and a sense of discipline instilled in the members of the society. There would also be a reduction in the rate of diseases caused by poor waste management.
            Industries too would benefit greatly as they would have available more recycled resources/ raw materials for greater manufacturing readily available at a much cheaper rate.
